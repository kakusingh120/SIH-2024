NAME & ORIGIN (Etymology)
The Marathi language and the terms "Maharashtra," "Marathi," and "Maratha" trace back to Maharashtri Prakrit. While the exact origin remains uncertain, theories suggest that "Maratha" and "Maharashtra" may have evolved from "Mahā" and "Rāṣṭrikā," possibly referring to a tribe or ruling dynasty in the Deccan region. Another theory connects it to "mahā" (great) and "ratha" (chariot), suggesting a northern warrior group that migrated south. Ancient texts like the Harivamsa hint at connections between the Rastrikas, ancestors of the Marathas, and regions like Anaratta and the Saurastras. Some believe "Maharashtra" comes from "mahā" (great) and "rāṣṭra" (nation), although this interpretation is debated by modern scholars.
